---

### Test 7: Score Color Coding

### Test 9: Empty State vs Loading State
**Loading State:**
```
🔄 (spinner animation)
Loading results...
```

**Empty State:**
```
📄 (static document icon)

```

**Verify they're different:**

## 🔧 Browser Console Testing

### Check API Calls
**Open Browser Console (F12) and look for:**

```javascript
// Successful API call
🔄 Making API request to: http://localhost:5001/api/submissions/teacher/recent?limit=10
✅ Response received: 200 OK
✅ Response data: { success: true, data: {...} }

// Stats API call
🔄 Making API request to: http://localhost:5001/api/submissions/teacher/stats
✅ Response received: 200 OK
✅ Response data: { success: true, data: {...} }
```

**No errors should appear like:**
- ❌ 401 Unauthorized
- ❌ 403 Forbidden
- ❌ 500 Server Error
- ❌ Network Error

## 🔍 Backend API Testing (Using cURL)

### Test 1: Get Recent Results
```bash
# First, get a token by logging in
TOKEN="your_auth_token_here"

# Test the endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5001/api/submissions/teacher/recent?limit=5
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "submissions": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "studentName": "...",
        "examTitle": "...",
        "score": 85,
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Get Teacher Stats
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:5001/api/submissions/teacher/stats
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "totalExams": 5,
    "totalStudents": 23,
    "totalResults": 47,
    "averageScore": 78.5
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No results yet" but students have submitted
**Possible Causes:**
- Submissions status is not 'completed'
- Exams not created by logged-in teacher
- Teacher ID mismatch

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check database
mongo
use examination_system
db.submissions.find({ status: 'completed' })
db.exams.find({ createdBy: 'teacher_id_here' })
```

### Issue 2: Loading forever
**Possible Causes:**
- Backend not running
- API endpoint not responding
- Network error

**Solution:**
1. Check backend is running: `lsof -i :5001`
2. Check backend logs: `tail -f backend/backend.log`
3. Test API directly: `curl http://localhost:5001/api/submissions/teacher/recent`

### Issue 3: 401 Unauthorized
**Cause:** Auth token missing or invalid

**Solution:**
1. Check localStorage has token: `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`
2. Re-login to get new token
3. Check token expiration

### Issue 4: Wrong statistics
**Possible Causes:**
- Database query filtering incorrectly
- Submissions from other teachers included

**Solution:**
- Check backend logs for query results
- Verify teacher ID in requests
- Check database directly

### Issue 5: Dates not formatted
**Cause:** Date value is string, not Date object

**Solution:**
- Check API returns ISO 8601 date strings
- Ensure `new Date(result.date)` is called in frontend
- Verify date is not null/undefined
